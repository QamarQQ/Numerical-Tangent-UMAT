# Numerical Computation of Material Tangent in Implicit Finite Element Analysis: Implementation within Abaqus UMAT Subroutine

This document (Guide.pdf) offers a brief summary of the numerical computation of the material tangent within implicit Finite Element Analysis (FEA), with a focus on its implementation within the Abaqus UMAT subroutine. It begins with an introduction emphasizing the importance of the material tangent in FEA simulations and the challenges associated with its analytical derivation. The methodology section delves into the use of finite difference methods, particularly the forward difference first-order scheme, for approximating the Jacobian material tangent. Practical considerations such as numerical effects and floating-point arithmetic are discussed in detail. Subsequently, the document outlines a step-by-step methodology for computing the numerical tangent, integrating insights from the newly added section on Finite Difference Methods. Finally, a Fortran code snippet for the UMAT subroutine is provided, illustrating the practical implementation details of the numerical tangent computation. This document serves as a beginner's guide for understanding and implementing the numerical computation of the material tangent in implicit FEA simulations.
