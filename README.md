# Numerical Computation of Material Tangent in Implicit Finite Element Analysis: Implementation within Abaqus UMAT Subroutine

The document (Numerical_Computation_of_Material_Tangent_UMAT_Abaqus.pdf) serves as a beginner's guide to the numerical computation of the material tangent in the realm of implicit Finite Element Analysis (FEA). It specifically focuses on its implementation within the Abaqus UMAT subroutine.

The document begins with an introduction that outlines the importance of the material tangent in FEA and the challenges associated with its analytical derivation. It discusses the rationale behind utilizing numerical methods to compute the tangent and highlights considerations such as numerical effects and floating-point arithmetic.

Subsequently, the methodology section delves into the process of computing the numerical tangent using finite difference methods, with a particular emphasis on the forward difference first-order scheme. It explains the step-by-step procedure for perturbing the strain components and computing the corresponding stress responses to approximate the Jacobian material tangent.

Furthermore, the document presents a Fortran code snippet for the UMAT subroutine (Fortran_Code_for_Abaqus_UMAT_Subroutine.f), tailored to implement the numerical tangent computation. The code demonstrates the practical implementation details, including perturbing the strain components, computing stresses, and approximating the material tangent using finite differences.
